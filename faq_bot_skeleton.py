"""
The file_input function is used to store the data from the txt file containing. Each line is read and added to the array. 
args: filename - the name of the file is passed as argument 

regularexpressions.txt contains the regex expressions of each questions

questions.txt contains 44 questions. 2 questions in one line for each answer. 

regex patterns are created in such a way even if the order of the questions changes, still matches the pattern
for example the pattern matches for the both questions "what is token python?" and "what python token is?"

strategy used to find best match:
each words in the user questions including the errors found are saved into a list.
list having the most length means,it have the best match question to the expressions.
