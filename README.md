regex patterns are created in such a way even if the order of the questions changes, still matches the pattern
for example the pattern matches for the both questions "what is token python?" and "what python token is?"

strategy used to find best match:
each words in the user questions including the errors found are saved into a list.
list having the most length means,it have the best match question to the expressions.
